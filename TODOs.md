# What I want to do:

- Create accordion for the projects
- - On Click they dropdown exposing flex box row split in half showing on one side
- - 1. Estimated cost for the project.
- - 2. Thermometer type scale showing how much we've saved toward that total cost.

- Be able to edit Expenses, Projects, etc.
- - ~~name/cost/date any properties, not just priority~~

-
